# DRM Service 

DRM (Digital Rights Management) is a technology that enables content creators and distributors to safeguard their media content on the TP Streams system, ensuring that only authorized users have access during processing and delivery. It prevents unauthorized copying and distribution, maintaining content security and protecting ownership rights.

Currently, there are two major DRM providers:

- Widevine by Google: This DRM solution is used for Windows, Linux, and Android devices, ensuring content protection and security on these platforms.

- FairPlay by Apple: FairPlay is Apple's DRM technology specifically designed for Mac and iOS devices, safeguarding media content and maintaining copyright protection for users of these devices.

DRM Service consists of two parts
- Encrypting the content
- Getting license to playback the content (Widevine and FairPlay)
