# Screen Capture Prevention Overview

Screen capture prevention is essential for protecting digital content from unauthorized copying. Here's a simple guide to understand how screen capture prevention works across different devices:

## Preventing Screen Capture:

### 1. In Apps:
   - **Android Apps:**
     - We can prevent the screen capture in andriod app using our [Andriod SDK](../category/android-native-sdk) 
   - **iOS Apps and Safari:**
     - Screen capture can be prevented in Native Flutter or Native App with our [IOS SDK](../category/ios-native-sdk)

### 2. Mobile Browsers:
   - **Android Browsers:**
     - Some Android browsers (like Chrome) can block screen recording, but it depends on your browsers.
   - **IOS Safari:** 
     - Fairplay DRM can prevent screen capture in Safari. 

### 3. Desktop Browsers:
   - **Mac Desktop/Laptop:**
     - Screen capture prevention in Safari possible with Fairplay DRM.
   - **Windows, Linux:**
     -  There's no way to completely block screen recording on desktop browsers like Chrome or Firefox because they only support Level 3 (L3) of Widevine DRM.  to know more about you can find [here](./widevine-specs.md)
## Extra Protection:
   - **Adding Watermarks:**

      - We offer watermarks to mark your content as protected.
