# Screen Capture Prevention Overview

Screen capture prevention is essential for protecting digital content from unauthorized copying. Here's a simple guide to understand how screen capture prevention works across different devices:

## Preventing Screen Capture:

### 1. In Apps:
   - **Android Apps:**
     - By using specific tools called DRM SDKs (like Widevine or Fairkey), developers can stop users from recording screens within their Android apps.
   - **iOS Apps and Safari:**
     - For iPhones and iPads, Fairplay DRM can be set up to prevent screen recording in apps and Safari. It's slightly different for Widevine-protected content on iOS.

### 2. On Browsers:
   - **Android Browsers:**
     - Chrome on some Android phones may have features to block screen recording for certain content. However, this isn't guaranteed
    
    

### 3. Desktop Browsers:
   - **Mac Desktop/Laptop:**
     - Screen capture can only be prevented in Safari with [Fairplay DRM ](./encryption/fairplay-encryption.md). However, screen capture cannot be prevented in other main browsers like Chrome, Firefox.
   - **Windows, Linux:**
     - Unfortunately, there's no way to completely block screen recording on desktop browsers like Chrome or Firefox .
## Extra Protection:

### Adding Watermarks:

Even if someone manages to record the screen, we can put a watermark, like a small logo, on the video. This makes it less useful if they try to share it.
