# Introduction


- A live stream is a real-time video broadcast delivered through a streaming platform. You can create live streams, allowing users to ingest media content into the TP Streams system for processing and delivery.

- With the TP Streams system, you have the ability to create live streams in two distinct ways:

1. [Create a live stream instantly](create_live_stream_instantly)
2. [Schedule live streams and start them later](../category/schedule-a-live-stream)
