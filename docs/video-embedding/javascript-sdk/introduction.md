# About player SDK

Our player SDK enables you to interact with embedded Testpress players through the code on your web page. You can modify the default behavior of the player for features like looping, execute custom functions on particular playback events, and even set basic properties like the volume, and playback rate of the player.

The SDK, as a JavaScript library, is completely separate from the API. You connect to it differently, and it gives you a different range of options.
